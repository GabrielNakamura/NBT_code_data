# General overview

This repository contains the data and code used in the analysis of the
manuscript entitled **"The macroecology of knowledge: Spatio-temporal
patterns of name-bearing types in biodiversity science"**.

In this study we characterized different aspects of spatial and temporal
patterns of fish Name Bearing Types (NBT) among countries and world
regions. The characteristics comprises the number of total NBT, the NBT
flowing among different world regions, the characteristics of regions
and countries regarding the source of NBT in their biological
collection, the level of underepresentation of native species and the
level of overepresentation of non-native species for each country.

We discuss how the fundamental knowledge in fish species is distributed
and its implications for science development and knowledge sharing.
